# airbnb-price-prediction
Airbnb is a well-known web platform that makes it easier to find lodging and travel experiences.Keep in mind that it has clients all over the world. It is quite important to take into consideration the pricing of the houses in order to lure and keep customers and reduce churn.
This project aims to develop a model using linear regression as well as random forest regression to predict Airbnb booking prices based on various factors.
## What are the objectives?
+ Build a model used to predict booking prices
+ Compare the performance of the two models: linear regression and random forest regression.

## Conclusion 
From the models you can see that both models did predict the values,
however the RMSE of the linear regression model is 222. whereas the RMSE of
the random forest regression model is 106.19.
So we can say, Random Forest Regression is better than the Linear Regression model
